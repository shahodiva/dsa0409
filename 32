# prompt: Scenario: You work as a data scientist for a real estate company. The company has collected 
# data on various houses, including features such as the size of the house, number of bedrooms, 
# location, and other relevant attributes. The marketing team wants to build a predictive model to 
# estimate the price of houses based on their features. They believe that linear regression modeling 
# can be an effective approach for this task. 
# Question:Your task is write a Python program to perform bivariate analysis and build a linear 
# regression model to predict house prices based on a selected feature (e.g., house size) from the 
# dataset. Additionally, you need to evaluate the model's performance to ensure its accuracy and 
# reliability.
