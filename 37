# prompt:  Scenario: You are a data scientist working for an educational institution, and you want to 
# explore the correlation between students' study time and their exam scores. You have collected data 
# from a group of students, noting their study time in hours and their corresponding scores in an 
# exam. 
# Question: Identify any potential correlation between study time and exam scores and explore 
# various plotting functions to visualize this relationship effectively. 

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Create a sample dataset for study time and exam scores
data = {'Study Time (hours)': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
        'Exam Score': [50, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate the correlation
correlation = df['Study Time (hours)'].corr(df['Exam Score'])
print(f"Correlation between Study Time and Exam Score: {correlation}")

# Visualize the relationship using a scatter plot
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.scatter(df['Study Time (hours)'], df['Exam Score'])
plt.title('Study Time vs. Exam Score')
plt.xlabel('Study Time (hours)')
plt.ylabel('Exam Score')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

# Visualize using a line plot (if you want to show a trend, although scatter is better for correlation)
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.plot(df['Study Time (hours)'], df['Exam Score'])
plt.title('Study Time vs. Exam Score (Line Plot)')
plt.xlabel('Study Time (hours)')
plt.ylabel('Exam Score')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

# Visualize using a regression plot with seaborn (provides a line of best fit)
!pip install seaborn
import seaborn as sns

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.regplot(x='Study Time (hours)', y='Exam Score', data=df)
plt.title('Study Time vs. Exam Score with Regression Line')
plt.xlabel('Study Time (hours)')
plt.ylabel('Exam Score')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
