# prompt:  Scenario: You work for a weather data analysis company, and your team is responsible for 
# developing a program to calculate and analyze variability in temperature data for different cities. 
# Question: Write a python program will take in a dataset containing daily temperature readings for 
# each city over a year and perform the following tasks: 
# 1. Calculate the mean temperature for each city. 
# 2. Calculate the standard deviation of temperature for each city. 
# 3. Determine the city with the highest temperature range (difference between the highest and 
# lowest temperatures). 
# 4. Find the city with the most consistent temperature (the lowest standard deviation).

import numpy as np
# Sample dataset: Dictionary where keys are city names and values are lists of daily temperatures
